This tutorial covers my first steps of connecting an IoT device to QuestDB to
explore the features and functionality. After using InfluxDB as a main data
store for sensor data in the past, I'll be looking at the workflow and ease of
use from this perspective and showing how simple it is for me to make the switch
over to QuestDB.
