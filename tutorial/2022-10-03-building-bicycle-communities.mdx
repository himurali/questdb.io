We've had a UDP version of the InfluxDB Line Protocol (ILP) reader in QuestDB
for quite some time, but we've had customers ask for a TCP version of it, so we
delivered!

Using and configuring it are relatively simple, so this tutorial will walk you
through the basics of setting it up and using it. For an added bonus, we'll see
how to migrate from using InfluxDB to using QuestDB with a single-line
configuration change.
