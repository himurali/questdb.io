# Intro

Cycling tourism refers to recreational visits that involve leisure cycling as the primary reason for the holiday. They can be day trips or overnight stays involving large or small groups of cyclists riding short or long distances. While these tours can include cities, they tend to focus on visits to remote areas around the world.

Bicycle tourism is comprised of several smaller niches, like:

* Mountain biking
* Road cycling
* Family cycling
* Tours and expeditions

NNCF has pioneered all the above cycle experiences.
