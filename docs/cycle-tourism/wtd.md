This page describes how to query data from QuestDB using different programming
languages and tools.

For ad-hoc SQL queries, including CSV download and charting use the web console.
Applications can choose between the HTTP REST API which returns JSON or use
the PostgreSQL wire protocol. 

## Web Console

QuestDB ships with an embedded Web Console running by default on port `9000`.
