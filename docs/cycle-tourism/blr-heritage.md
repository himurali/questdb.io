## Bengaluru Rides

Cycling enthusiasts got  a chance to learn more about the history of Bengaluru as the Tourism Department, along with NNCF,  organised two theme-based rides on Tuesday September 27 on the eve of World Tourism Day.


The rides are divided into a ‘Heritage’ and a ‘History’ circuit. The organisers will provide 60 participants with cycles and take them on a tour of places of interest around M.G. Road and Basavangudi.
