## BCDC

BCDC envisions to transform the nicycle design and making stack leading to sustainable mobility. BCDC is the response of india for a sustaining and green economy - where we intend to bring in the innovation in design and modern practices in manufacturability.
BCDC is a growing community of Bicycle Designers and Product creators working with tech, across diverse industries, schools and non-profits. We aim to get the best bicycle designers on our platform and host a virtual design summit.

Inspire. Create. Build. Make in India.

The Program is designed in 2 stages Stage 1. In the first stage we conduct the Hackathon .Stage 2. Host a Designer and Maker Summit
Over 200 designers, will participate in the event.

Material technology to be the focus of the hackathon.
IM4 the latest manufacturing tech shall be the stack on which the bicycle will be designed and manufactured.

## Design for India

We hope this design challenge may lead to new, disruptive ideas, increasing the chance for India to be the leader in bicycle industry: providing the right bicycle to the people who need it, at the right time, in a convenient, affordable, easy and accessible way, and – if possible – at the lowest cost. We encourage the next generation of designers to use their creative power to shape mobility and transport in india.Create well-designed, practical bicycles that improve access, comfort, safety and convenience .
