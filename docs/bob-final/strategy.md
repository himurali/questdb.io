# Program Flow For Corporate
1. [Design in India](#ecosystem)
2. [Make in India](#Handshake)
3. [Innovate in India](#round-table)
 

India was one of the leaders in Bicycle Manufacturing , but in the last two decades India has LOST the opportunity to be a world leader in exporting bicycles. China and Taiwan have captured the opportunity and have developed complete ecosystems for making the best cycles. BCDC creates multiple windows to explore initiatives to win in the global market. Post Corona with the push for "Make In India" and the reduction on the dependency of chinese imports world over - there is a great opportunity for India to promote cycles and sustainability.

## Design in India

Indian cycle manufacturing is lagging in research and design to take on the global competition. We just don’t need a designer with a bicycle design. What we need is a design culture for bicycle designing. This is the first step in this direction , done for the first time in India. Great design starts with the customer


## Make In India
The dependence of the industry on institutional sales is substantial. Indian Middle class has drifted away from the bicycle to the two wheeler and cars. This shift need to be reversed by enabling cycles that meet the multiple needs of the middle class.
