Take the lead and help us develop our sustainable tourism model in your area. Collaborate with our growing network of Local Ambassadors worldwide.



Why are the ambassadors a fundamental part of Fairbnb.coop?

THEY HELP ACTIVATING NEW TRAVEL DESTINATIONS
We activate new cities only when we find a local Ambassador and in this way guests can start to make bookings with Fairbnb.coop


COORDINATE LOCAL ACTIVITIES AND EVENTS
In order to reinforce and promote Fairbnb.coop at a local level, we nurture positive discussions between guests, hosts, inhabitants, companies, etc. That is the best way to make our project grow!


LOOK FOR PARTNERS AND HOSTS IN THE TERRITORY
We increase our network and help the development of the platform at a local level


COLLABORATE WITH THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES
To ensure that hosts and apartments abide by regulations set by the local municipality or council, you will verify each listing in line with these standards and with the values of Fairbnb.
