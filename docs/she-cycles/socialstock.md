## Handshake
 Let's change tourism - one booking at a time
We work to connect conscious travellers with fair hosts to promote stronger, more sustainable and equitable communities all around the world.

We are inspired by Fair Trade, Circular Economy and Sustainable Development Goals. Like all the other platforms we ask for a fee for your bookings but unlike other platforms we transfer 50% of the commision to community projects in the host area with the goal to redistribute wealth and create jobs.

Cooperation and consensus are at the heart of our model. We are on a journey to become a home for all those who want to participate and grow this model of solidarity and participatory economy: hosts, guests, local business owners, neighbours are all welcome.

A non extractive alternative to the current vacation rental platforms
WE PRIORITIZE PEOPLE OVER PROFIT.
We offer the potential for authentic, sustainable and intimate travel experiences while facilitating the development of socially relevant projects within communities worldwide.
