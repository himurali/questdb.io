2. Place the cyclist  at the center of the ecosystem mapping exercize, then position the other players in the space around.

**Use different types of line  (appearance, colour, stroke) to represent different kinds of relationship such as information exchange, money exchange, etc** Try to put cyclist closer to the center the ones that have more importance for the cyclist. When they are all on the map, start tracing connections between the cyclist and other players and then among the latter.!
