## Handshake

NNCF initiates the conversation with the community leadership and the key stakeholders to make the community as a Lead Ride Community.

A Lead Ride Community performs the following key roles.

1. Agrees to organize the Lead Ride on World Cycle Day 
2. Connects and Convenes the Active Mobility Enabling Leaders and Players
3. Commits funding for the Lead Ride 
4. The outreach and branding campaign  is supported 
5. Appoints Lead Ride Buddies  in the community to lead the effort of Active Mobility Transformation.
