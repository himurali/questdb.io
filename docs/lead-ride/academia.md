Intellectual growth and academic achievement should not come at the expense of wellbeing. Together, we can create a culture at your campus
that embraces the importance of mental health and wellbeing. To live healthy and purposeful lives is a necessary complement to learning science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and the humanities.  Further develop physical culture and mass sports and possibility of exploring the world on cycles -  Cycling regularly and regular physical activity is the most dramatic, harmless, relaxing, "free medicine" and "free treatment" that creates symptoms for health. 10% of human deaths worldwide are related to physical inactivity.

## Handshake

NNCF initiates the conversation with the Academic leadership and the key stakeholders to make the Institute as a Lead Ride Institute.

A Lead Ride Institute performs the following key roles.

1. Agrees to organize the Lead Ride Program on World Cycle Day 
2. Connects and Convenes the Active Mobility Ecosystem players
3. Commits funding for the Lead Ride Program in the University
4. Appoints Lead Ride Buddies in the University to lead the effort of Active Mobility Transformation.

## Lead Ride Program Stages
The Lead Ride University Program consists of two core stages, with   interactive sessions, as well as: 


### Stage 1 
Active Mobility Awareness  - Foundation , a  guided course where students will learn the basics of Active Mobility and discover opportunities  for enhancing Active Mobility in their campus
A lot of the inner-workings of Active Mobility and its impact are explored in the   `Active Mobility Awareness ` module.

-   Introduction to  `Active Mobility Concept` or `Active Mobility Principles` to generate interest in the student and faculty community 
-   Organizing  `Active Travel` to students - they can explore cultures - people and opportunities and network

### Stage 2
Despite improved understanding of the links between  Active Mobility (AM) and human well-being, no real progress has been made in India in that direction. To kickstart the movement, fundamental work - conceptual, methodological and empirical - is needed to make AM ideas operational and meaningful to the general public.
