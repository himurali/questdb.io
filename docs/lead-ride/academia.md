Each software release of QuestDB is distributed via the
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) package manager.

## Install Homebrew

Users who already have Homebrew installed may skip this section and proceed to  
## Install QuestDB

To install QuestDB via Homebrew, run the following command:

```shell
brew install questdb
```
 

## Uninstall QuestDB

To remove QuestDB, use Homebrew's `uninstall` command:

```shell
questdb uninstall
```

## Troubleshooting Homebrew issues

It's recommended to first run `update` before trying to install packages or
diagnose errors:

```shell
brew update
```

Homebrew comes with a basic diagnostic command which can help find
inconsistencies with system settings and permissions. This command will exit
with a non-zero status if any potential problems are found:

```shell
brew doctor
```
