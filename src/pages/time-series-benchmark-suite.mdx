When looking at multiple solutions for storing and analyzing large amounts of
time series data, it's common to see many open source systems claim to be the
easiest to maintain or are the fastest and most efficient at storing and writing
data. Reliable comparisons are one of the best ways for users to make the
decision which system fits their needs in terms of resource usage, speed, ease
of use and other requirements.

We decided to make it more transparent for developers to choose the right time
series database by providing support for testing and measuring database
performance that anyone can replicate.

## How is database performance measured?
